# Task
Cloud Computing Coursework
# 1. Development of a Cloud Software as a Service
The goal of the coursework is to make you apply the concepts and software development methods and
frameworks seen in class in order to develop a Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS). 
The coursework requires you to install, develop and test a Cloud SaaS in a virtualized environment according to the guidelines
described in this document. 

You should upload your final scripts and a technical report to describe the
functionality of your solution following the guidelines of the coursework brief document.

# 2. Online auctioning system.
Your task is to develop a RESTful SaaS for an auctioning system where users sell items while other users bid
for these items.

You should install, test and document your developments as described in Section 3. 

Your software should support the following Actions.
Action 1: Authorise users to access the auctioning API using the oAuth v2 protocol.

Action 2: Authorised users could post items for selling in the auctioning API.

Action 3: Authorised users could browse all items for sale in the auctioning API.

Action 4: Authorised users could bid for an item while it is in an auction.

Action 5: Highest bid authorised user wins the item after the end of the auction.

Action 6: Authorised users could browse for bidding history of an item that is sold.

You are advised to use the Django RESTful API framework to develop your software. You are also advised to
use code samples from the lab tutorials and online sources by providing the appropriate references (in text
and in code). You are encouraged to improvise providing clear descriptions of your functionality and your
implementation decisions.
